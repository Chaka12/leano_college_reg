## Design Philosophy

### Visual Language
**Modern African Aesthetic**: The design embraces a contemporary African visual language that reflects both the local Lesotho culture and modern educational excellence. This creates an authentic yet aspirational brand experience that resonates with prospective students while positioning Leano College as a forward-thinking institution.

### Color Palette
**Primary Colors**:
- **Deep Forest Green (#1B4332)**: Represents growth, knowledge, and the natural beauty of Lesotho
- **Warm Terracotta (#D4A574)**: Reflects the earth tones of the Lesotho landscape and warmth of community
- **Soft Cream (#F8F6F0)**: Clean, accessible background that ensures excellent readability

**Accent Colors**:
- **Sage Green (#74A57F)**: For secondary elements and subtle highlights
- **Charcoal (#2D3436)**: For body text and professional elements

This palette draws inspiration from Lesotho's natural environment while maintaining professional credibility and accessibility standards.

### Typography
**Display Font**: Canela - A sophisticated serif that conveys academic excellence and tradition
